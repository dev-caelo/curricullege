				<h1>What are the types of college</h1>
				<div class="infoHeadLineWrapper">
					<h1>admissions?</h1>
					<div class="infoHeadLine"></div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyHead">
				Regular Admission
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyText">
				Regular applications are reviewed together after applications are closed. No
				decisions are made until after all of these applications are reviewed. 
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyHead">
				Rolling Admission
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyText">
				Rolling admissions are much more flexible to applicants, giving a larger window  to apply and are reviewed at a “first-come, first-serve” basis - this gives
				applicants the incentive to apply early to hear back from admissions as soon as
				possible.
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyHead">
				Open Admission
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyText">
				Open admissions are typical in community and online colleges; in which applicants
				that have met their respective college's prerequisites are generally accepted.
			</div>
			<div class="infoHeaderRight">
				<h1>What are early</h1>
				<div class="infoHeadLineWrapper right">
					<h1>admissions?</h1>
					<div class="infoHeadLine left"></div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyTextLeft">
				Some colleges allow for early admissions, which allows prospective students
				to apply by an earlier deadline and receive results ahead of regular admissions.
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyHeadLeft">
				Early Action
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyTextLeft">
				Similar to Early Decision, though students are not fully committed to the college
				when applied and can continue to apply for other colleges and/or safety
				schools.
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyTextLeft">
				Though, there is an option for Single-Choice Early Action, in which applicants
				may not apply for other colleges during until the regular admissions period.
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyHeadLeft">
				Early Evaluation
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyTextLeft">
				Unlike the other early choices, Early Evaluation does not admit the applicant
				but rather gives applicants an evaluation of how likely he or she is in getting
				into that college.
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyTextLeft">
				However, this does NOT guarantee admission to that college during the
				regular admissions season. 
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyHeadLeft">
				Early Decision
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyTextLeft">
				For confident and prospective students, early decision allows for early
				committment to a college; though this is very restictive in that applicants, if
				accepted, must attend this college. 
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyTextLeft">
				Violating Early Decision Agreements will get applicants into trouble!
			</div>
			<div class="infoHeaderLeft" id="Applications">
				<h1>What types of</h1>
				<div class="infoHeadLineWrapper">
					<h1>applications are there?</h1>
					<div class="infoHeadLine small"></div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyText">
				Different colleges use different types of applications. Make sure you research what type of application your desired college uses before applying. 
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyHead">
				Common App
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyText">
				The
				<a class="infoButton" href="https://www.commonapp.org/">Common App</a>
				has over 900 participating colleges . Like other applications, 
				they are holistic and require different components. With its essays being flexible enough for reuse in school-specific applications, and many top universities embracing it, the Common App is a great, flexible option!
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyHead">
				Universal Application
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyText">
				Although the 
				<a class="infoButton" href="https://www.universalcollegeapp.com/">Universal Application</a>
				only has about 44 participating colleges, it’s still
				worth taking a look at the Universal App as it’s newer and has improved features from 
				the Common App.  Some IVY league schools accept the Universal Application, so it’s
				worth considering!
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyHead">
				Coalition Application
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyText">
				With over 140 participating colleges, the <a class="infoButton" href="http://www.coalitionforcollegeaccess.org/">Coalition Application</a> is unique compared to
				the other types of college apps. For once, the Coalition Application serves as a 
				platform that allows students to build a portfolio of their works of all their 4 years 
				of high school. 
				That means essays can be substituted with a body of other works 
				and projects!
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyHead">
				Shared Applications for a System of Colleges
			</div>
			<div class="infoBodyText">
				Some schools use applications that can be used by all colleges in the same school system. For example, UC  (University of California) schools use 
				<a class="infoButton" href="https://apply.universityofcalifornia.edu">
				UC Applications</a>, 				while the State University of New York (SUNY) system of universities use the <a class="infoButton" href="https://www.suny.edu/applySUNY/">SUNY Application</a>. It is important to note that some school systems also include other forms of application such as the Common App, while others do not.

			<div class="topLine end"></div>
			<div class="infoHeaderLeft">
				<h1>Which one should I choose?</h1>
				<div class="infoBodyText">
					The best choice is entirely relative to your own pathway and your dream college, as all of these listed applications - and more - will give you the tools you need to get admitted into the college of your choice!
				</div>
				<div class="infoBodyText">
					Despite this, a good takeaway from this list is to choose the method that allows you to most effectively communicate yourself to your college; your character, your aspirations, your achievements are all important in standing out in the large pool of applicants - so choose the method that allows you to truly showcase yourself!
