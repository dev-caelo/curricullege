hello! curricullege is a small startup project we have
embarked on throughout this unprecedented (overused i know) time.

it has served to not only showcase our skills and teamworking abilities,
but also a way to support other students suffering under the same situation - especially
with college application season around the corner.

anyways, thanks for checking out my github! 
even so, i honestly have no idea how you arrived here (perhaps i added this as part of my college application? internship?)

personally, this page has taught me much about fundamental website creation - as evidenced by the sphagetti that is most of the earlier
css files. (index and styles are just,, no). it has also introduced me to javascript, and its various applications in web development - which i used (very) sparingly in this project < refer to resources page under support > 
-also it is probably the cleanest code u can find in this project (thanks apcsa)

in the end, this project was truly carried by the rest of @teamCurricullege
- dayo and jinwoo compiled all of the useful information in the site, and had this idea in the first place
- mia is fully responsible for the amazing design of all our pages (except resources, thats why it looks out of place sorry!!!)

all i did was make it work out in code. it was fun though!



thank you for visiting! we truly hope the site will be useful for other students, best of luck to all! - teamCurricullege

and thanks for visiting my github! i hope its less of an eyesore in the future! - carlo 7/8/20

EDIT: [10/9/20]
- our local library has endorsed the site and paid for our use of the domain for 2 years! 
- also, the site is officially up on www.curricullege.com [its been out since september but i forgot this page existed!]
