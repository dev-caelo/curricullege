# Curricullege

- 7/8/20
Hello! Curricullege is a small startup project we have
worked on throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in cooperation with
our local public library in their college readiness initiative.

It has served to not only showcase our skills and teamworking abilities,
but also a way to support other students in our community applying to college 
under the current situation. 

Personally, this page has taught me much about the fundamentals of website development - as evidenced by the sphagetti that is most of the earlier
css files. (index and styles look like a nightmare). It has also introduced me to javascript, and its various applications in web development - which i used (very) sparingly in this project < refer to resources page under support > 
- EDIT: The JS component was scrapped for a list design as in the current version

In the end, this project was truly carried by the rest of @teamCurricullege
- Dayo and Jinwoo compiled all of the useful information in the site, and had this idea in the first place
- Mia is fully responsible for the amazing finalized design of all our pages (such as this!)

I was in charge of the prototype designs and implementing the final designs with HTML and CSS.

Thank you for visiting! we truly hope the site will be useful for other students, best of luck to all! - teamCurricullege
